Each shelved item component represents a project I've completed in teaching myself FrontEnd web developemnt. Hover over the shelved projects to initialize a unique animiation and on click, a new tab will open to the project's respective GitHub repo.

The light switch embedded over the hanging pendant can be used to toggle the site's Dark Mode. The mode the user's select will be saved in local storage so upon return, that mode will be preserved.
